  title: Energy Measurement API
  description: Company name, project name, purpose of the api creation, date of last update, sometimes code author name.
  # Always change the version of the API endpoints and contracts, keeping compatibility in the major version. Also keep the previous versions available for retro compatibility.
  # I.E. Client versions 1.*.* are able to access the /v1/* endpoints without changing any code. Minor versions only fix typos and unpredicted behavior, adding endpoints is possible but not removing previous ones.
  # When version 2.0.0 is release under /v2/* endpoint, /v1 is kept for keeping version 1.*.* working.
  version: "1.0.0"
# the domain of the service, site can be added like api.site_name.your_company.com, keeping site_name.your_company.com for dashboards or any other webapp based on api.site_name.your_company.com.
